# Sprint review

## Positive reviews
We are almost finished with the whole website.
The next sprint will be dedicated to last bug fixes and the final presentation, as well as the several documentations we have to write.

## Negative reviews
Due to a lack of organisation, we couldn't finish a few tickets, so it's the same problem as the former sprint.
Unfortunately, we won't have the time to work on the mobile app, since we chose to prioritize the website to make it as perfect as possible.

## Questions
None.

## Ideas for improvement
We definitely need to improve our organization as the next sprint will be the last.
