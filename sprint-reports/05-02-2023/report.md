# Sprint review

## Positive reviews

Overall, we became more productive and are almost done with the main pages. We found a few ideas and will continue to work on the website's design.

## Negative reviews

Since we became more strict regarding our code when reviewing pull requests, we have to work a bit more and harder. It could eventually lead to disagreements or quarrels among the group, but we'll get through this.

## Questions

None;

## Ideas for improvement

After adding a few pages (for example the admin pages), we still need to work on our website's design.
