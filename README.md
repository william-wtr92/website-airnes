## Airneis Project SDV

<h1>Context</h1>
Ã€IRNEIS ("furniture" in Scottish Gaelic) is a Scottish company that resells furniture designed by Scottish designers. They have expressed their desire to move into the digital age and wish to create their own e-commerce solution to reach an international clientele and expend the one they already have locally.
The final deliverable required is a mobile-first e-commerce website and a mobile application, with a web backoffice to manage the content, an integrated content and a secure and maintainable payment system over time.
