# Our components organization

In this project, we have 3 types of components:
- `/app` ones: components that are used in the whole app, such as category or product;
- `/layout` ones: components that are used in the layout, such as nav or footer;
- `/utils` ones: little components used for small parts, such as a form field, or a navlink.

Finally, we have a `validation` folder that contains all the yup validation used in the app.
